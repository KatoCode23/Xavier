          Brooklyn holds a special place in many people’s hearts. It is one of
          five boroughs in New York City and it’s been undergoing some significant
          changes for quite awhile. Gentrification is real and it is happening all around the city.
          Brooklyn has been under the gentrification umbrella for quite some time.
          These changes are bringing in different businesses and different types
          of people that are disturbing the chemistry of the community.
          The genuine vibe and culture of the different BK communities are
          like no other. BK b4 Barclays is here to keep the culture of Brooklyn alive.
        </p>
        <p>BK b4 Barclays™ is looking to secure all things Brooklyn and not let gentrification
           change its rich past and history. There are many people moving out of the borough to
           find more affordable living arrangements. They are taking their stories with them.
           Whether it was a success or a struggle, growing up in Brooklyn was an experience.
           Brooklyn raised some of the culture’s biggest influences. Biggie Smalls, Jay Z, Spike Lee,
           and Mike Tyson are just a few of the people who came up on those BK streets.
           That Brooklyn is quickly disappearing and being replaced by a culture that most
           in the neighborhood don’t identify with.
        </p>

          This Saturday, in Brooklyn (of course), BK b4 Barclays™ is set to launch and celebrate BK.
          This event is open to the public and invited guests can partake in an evening of sharing stories,
          building connections, previewing the docu-series, check out some vintage BK photos while
          listening to the tunes of BK’s own DJ Clark Kent.
