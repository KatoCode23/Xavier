             Brooklyn holds a special place in many hearts. It is one of
             five boroughs in New York City and it’s been undergoing some significant
             changes for quite awhile. Gentrification is real and it is happening all around the city.
             Brooklyn has been under the gentrification umbrella for quite some time.
             These changes are bringing in different businesses and different types
             of people that are disturbing the chemistry of the community.
             The genuine vibe and culture of the different BK communities are
             like no other. BK b4 Barclays is here to keep the culture of Brooklyn alive.
           </p>
           <p>BK b4 Barclays™ is looking to secure all things Brooklyn and not let gentrification
              change its rich past and history. There are many people moving out of the borough to
              find more affordable living arrangements. They are taking their stories with them.
              Whether it was a success or a struggle, growing up in Brooklyn was an experience.
              Brooklyn raised some of the culture’s biggest influences. Biggie Smalls, Jay Z, Spike Lee,
              and Mike Tyson are just a few of the people who came up on those BK streets.
              That Brooklyn is quickly disappearing and being replaced by a culture that most
              in the neighborhood do not identify with.
